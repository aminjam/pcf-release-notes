## <a id='how-to-upgrade'></a> How to Upgrade

To upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, see [Upgrading <%= vars.platform_name %>](http://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).


## <a id='major-features'></a> New Features in <%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>

<%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following major features:

### <a id="bosh-overrides"></a> BOSH Director Manifest Overrides

In Ops Manager v2.10, you can use the `/api/v0/staged/director/overrides`
Ops Manager API endpoint to override properties in the BOSH Director manifest.
With this endpoint, you can only override properties that appear
in the instance groups and networks sections of the manifest.

You must be in Advanced Mode to use this feature.

For information on the Ops Manager API endpoints related to this feature, see [Advanced Manifest Configuration](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-10/opsman-api/#tag/Advanced-Manifest-Configuration) in Ops Manager API Documentation.

For information about enabling Advanced Mode using the Ops Manager API, see [Advanced Mode](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-10/opsman-api/#tag/Advanced-Mode) in Ops Manager API Documentation.

### <a id="runtime-config-overrides"></a> Override Runtime Config Properties Using the Ops Manager API

In Ops Manager v2.10, you can use an Ops Manager API endpoint to override
the runtime config properties in the BOSH Director manifest.

You must be in Advanced Mode to use this feature.

You can use the `api/v0/staged/director/runtime_configs/overrides` endpoint to override properties
in the runtime configs:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Runtime Config Names</th>
    <th>Add-on Names</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>ops_manager_dns_runtime</code></td>
    <td><ul>
      <li><code>bosh_dns</code></li>
      <li><code>bosh_dns_windows</code></li>
    </ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>ops_manager_system_metrics_runtime</code></td>
    <td><ul>
      <li><code>system_metrics_agent</code></li>
      <li><code>system_metrics_agent_windows</code></li>
    </ul></td>
  </tr>
</table>

For example, the log level for the BOSH DNS logs cannot be changed through the Ops Manager UI.
However, using the override, you can change the log level, perhaps to debug for more information
or to warning for less verbose logs.

+ [Provide a new list of runtime config overrides for the BOSH
Director](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-10/opsman-api/#tag/Advanced-Manifest-Configuration/paths/~1api~1v0~1staged~1director~1runtime_configs~1overrides/get)

### <a id='certs-om-ui'></a> View Certificates in the Ops Manager UI

The Ops Manager UI introduces a new tab called **Certificates**. This tab lists which of your certificates are rotated through the Ops Manager API, which certificates cannot be rotated through the Ops Manager API, and when each certificate is due to expire.

The **Certificates** tab displays all the certificates listed by the `/api/v0/deployed/certificates` endpoint, as well as the following details:

* **Certificate name:** The name of the certificate.
* **Product:** The product for which the certificate is issued, such as BOSH or MySQL.
* **Location:** Whether it is stored in Ops Manager or CredHub.
* **Type:** Whether it is a leaf certificate or a certificate authority (CA).
* **Configurable:** Whether it is configurable.
* **Valid until:** The expiry date and the number of days before expiration.

For more information, see [Using the Ops Manager Interface](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/ops-manager/2-10/pcf-interface.html).

### <a id='safety-checks'></a> CredHub Maestro Runs Safety Checks During Certificate Rotation

When you are rotating certificates that are stored in Ops Manager and CredHub, the CredHub Maestro CLI runs safety checks on Ops Manager API commands for certificate rotation. If an API command is unsafe, CredHub Maestro stops the command and returns an error. An API command is unsafe when you run it out of order, such as if you generate a new root certificate authority (CA) and attempt to activate it before clicking **Apply Changes**. Performing steps out of the correct order during certificate rotations can make your deployment unstable or risk downtime.

To skip these safety checks, you can pass the `skip_safety_check` parameter to the Ops Manager API endpoints for certificate rotation. This automatically appends the `--skip-safety-check` flag to the CredHub Maestro CLI commands that Ops Manager runs during the certificate rotation. Skipping the safety checks allows you to rotate your certificates in an unsafe manner when necessary. For example, if your CA has already expired and your apps are experiencing downtime, skipping safety checks allows you to bring your apps back faster.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> To use this feature in Ops Manager v2.10, you must have Pivotal Application Service (PAS) v2.8 or TAS for VMs v2.9 or later installed, and you must not have any version of Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) installed. If you are using an earlier version of PAS or have any version of TKGI installed, Ops Manager still runs safety checks, but they are not as comprehensive as CredHub Maestro safety checks.</p>
